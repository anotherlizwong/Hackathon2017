Digitial availability sign

Tired of people barging into your cube when you're in your groove on a task?
Sick of "just a quick question" when it's never just a *quick* question?
Feeling anti-social?
Just want to jam out to music without being interrupted?
Are you the 'unofficial' secretary of your department? ("Where's John...?")

Join my team to help create a digital availability sign!


**Customizable status**
"Do not disturb" for when you're fighting fires..
"Come back later" when that deadline is fast approaching
"Available" when you want to be social and entertain questions
"Out of the office" / "PTO until December"

**Integrate with your outlook calendar**
Not in your cube? Let people know if you're in the building (in meetings) , on business travel, or unreachable on PTO.

**Digital numbering/queueing system**
"Take a number...you're 12th in line. Your question is very important to us..."
